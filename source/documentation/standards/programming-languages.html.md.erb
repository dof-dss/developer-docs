# <%= current_page.data.title %>

In DSS we have standardised our programming lanaguages for bespoke software development:

- C#

The programming languages for our web content management solution (Drupal) are different
and are dictated by the Drupal plaform i.e.

- PHP

The small number of programming languages should make it easier for developers to:

- move around the organisation
- develop shared components
- improve personal development

## Frontend development

## Backend development

## Future direction

Government across the UK has already developed code to solve a huge number of common and
specific business requirements. In the interests of re-using this code we will consider
the use of a small range of programming languages within DSS; this will need to be small
enough in order to manage and large enough to reap the benefits of code re-use.

Ultimately we want to use the right tool for the job that will give us the best chance of building
services that best meet usersâ€™ needs in the most cost effective and efficient manner.
