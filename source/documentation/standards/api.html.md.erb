DSS follows the GDS [API technical and data standards][1].

The following sections describe DSS specific guidance to be followed.

## Use of REST

### Resources

Resources should be nouns not verbs and should be coarse grained and not fine grained. There are fundamentally
two types of resources:

- collections e.g. `/applications`
- instances e.g. `/applications/a1b2c3`

### Behaviour

REST behaviour is based on the HTTP specification:

- GET
- PUT
- POST
- DELETE
- HEAD

While GET relates directly to a *read* operation and DELETE relates directly to a *delete* operation, the PUT
 verb is normally used for *update* while the POST verb is normally used for *insert*.

## Base URL

For citizen based services the base URL is:

`https://api.servicename.nidirect.gov.uk`

## Media types

Media types consist of a format specification and parsing rules

- **Request**: `Accept` header
- **Response**: `Content-type` header

Example media types are:

- application/json
- application/xml
- text/html
- application/pdf

The DSS standard media type is `application/json`.

## Versioning

APIs should be versioned using the following standard:

e.g. `https://api.servicename.nidirect.gov.uk/v1`

## Security

## JSON responses

- Every accessbile resource must have a unique URL:

- JSON properties should use camelCase .e.g. accountName

- Use ISO 8601 standard for date/time timestamps and use UTC

```
{
  "href": "https://api.servicename.nidirect.gov.uk/v1/applications/a1b2c3"
  "applicationType": "basic"
  ...
  "createdTimestamp":"2019-06-01T08:00:123Z"
}
```

### Content negotiation

- the format of the contect return should be base on the `Accept` header
- header values are comma delimited in order of preference

`GET /applications/a1b2c3`

`Accept: application/json, text/plain`

### Linked content (parents and children)

Where the resource requested is either the parent of another object or the child or a parent object we refer
to the parent or child using an instance reference or `href`.

```
GET /applications/a1b2c3

200 OK
{
  "href": "https://api.servicename.nidirect.gov.uk/v1/applications/a1b2c3"
  "applicationType": "basic"
  "applicant": {
    "href": "https://api.servicename.nidirect.gov.uk/v1/applicants/x1y2z3"
  }
  ...
  "createdTimestamp":"2019-06-01T08:00:123Z"
}
```

### Pagination

Use query parameters `offset` and `limit`.

### Handling errors

Return a custom payload along with the standard error code.
