This guidance is derived from Software Architecture Patterns by Mark Richards published by O'Reilly.

## Introduction

Without a clear and well defined architecture most developers will resort to the de-facto standard traditional
layered architecture pattern (also called the n-tier aarchitecture). Applications lacking a formal architecture
are generally tightly coupled, difficult to change and have no clear vision or direction.

Architecture patters help define the basic characteristics and behaviour of an application. Knowing the
characteristics, strengths and weaknesses for each architecture pattern is necessary in order to choose the
one that meets your specific business needs and goals.

The most predominent pattern in use across the NICS has been the layered architecture pattern. However, going
forward it is vitally important that a decision on which pattern to use is being made and that it is justified
and formally recorded.

Patterns can be evaluated against the following criteria:

- Overall agility
- Ease of deployment
- Testability
- Performance
- Scalability
- Ease of development

## Layered architecture

### Description

Components are organised into horizontal layers, each performing a specific role within the application
(e.g. presentation logic or business logic). Although this pattern does not specify the number of layers
most layered architectures consist of four standard layers:

- presentation
- business
- persistence
- database

Each layer in the architecture forms an abstraction around the work that needs to be done to satisfy a
particular business request.

One of the powerful features of this pattern is the *separation of concerns* among components. Components
within a specific layer only deal with logic that pertains to that layer.

### Key concepts

In this pattern each of the layers is marked as being closed; a closed layer means that as a request moves
from layer to layer it must go through the layer below it to get the next layer below that. Therefore the key
concept in this pattern is known as *layers of isolation*.

The layers of isolation concept means that changes made in one layer of the architecture generally don't
impact or affect components in other layers. It also means that each layer is independent of the other
layers, having little of no knowledge of the inner workings of the other layers.

One important consideration in this pattern is in the arena of shared services. The closed nature of each
layer would make it difficult to reuse components. Therefore it is often acceptable to introduce a *services*
layer that can provide access to the deeper layers in the model.

### Considerations

The layered architecture pattern is a solid general-purpose pattern, making it a good starting point for
most applications. This has been the de-facto pattern in use across the NICS up until this point (summer 2019).

However, there are a couple of things to consider when choosing this pattern:

1. The *architecture sinkhole anti-pattern*, where request flow through multiple layers with little or no
logic performed in each layer; and

2. the pattern lends itself to monolithic applications.

### Analysis

#### Overall agility

Rating: Low

It is very time consuming making changes to monolithic applications and tightly coupled applications.

#### Ease of deployment

Rating: Low

Deployment can be an issue, particulary for larger applications. A change to a single component can
require a redeployment of the entire application, resulting in deployments that need to be planned
and scheduled often out of hours. Therefore it does not lend itself well to a continuous delivery
pipeline.

#### Testability

Rating: High

As components sit in particular layers other layers can be mocked or stubbed.

#### Performance

Rating: Low

The inefficiencies of having to go through mulitple layers of the architecture to fulfill
a business request means that generally speaking this pattern does not lend itself to high
performance applications.

#### Scalability

Rating: Low

This architecture can be scaled by splitting the layers into separate physical or virtual
machines or replicating the entire application into nodes, but overall the granularity is
too braod making it expensive to scale.

#### Ease of development

Rating: High

This is a well-known pattern and is not overly complex to implement. It becomes a natural
choice for most application development.
