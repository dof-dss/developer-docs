The apps you build may be deployed on DSS infrastructure or in a public cloud.

In order for applications to work effectively in a cloud environment there are a number of principles
that must be followed.

The portability of our applications (i.e. the ability to move them easily from one
environment to another) is dependent up us following these principles no matter what the initial target
environment might be.

##12-factor application principles

All applications must follow these practices to work in modern cloud basesd enviroments that support
features such as auto-scaling and automatic fail-over. The [12factor.net website](https://12factor.net)
provides much more detail on each of the practices summarised below.

| Principle | Meaning |
| --------- | ------- |
| One codebase many deploys | Each of your apps needs is own verion-controlled repository |
| Isolate dependencies | All required dependencies must be vendored into your software system |
| Store your configuration in the environment | Ensure you separate the storage of your code and configuration |
| Backing services | All your backing services should be loosely coupled to your code |
| Strictly separate build, release and run stages | There should be a strict separation between building, releasing and running the code |
| Stateless processes | Build stateless processes where intermediate data is stored in your backing services and not in running code |
| Port binding | Your application should interface to the world via an API |
| Concurrency | Ensure all your processes are running separately so your application can scale easily |
| Disposability | Your should be able to rapidly release new code and applications should be able to start back up fast and cleanly following shut down |
| Development/Production parity | Applications should be rapidly deployed from their development environment to production |
| Logs | Maintain and archive log files so you have visibility of how our application works over time |
| Administrative processes | Rn one-off administrative processes in your production environment |
